# Snake Game

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake to eat food items (apples) and grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or the snake's own body. This version of the Snake Game was implemented using Java and expanded with additional features such as scoring, pause and start functionality, moving apples, changing backgrounds, and audio effects.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any preferred Java development environment
- **Graphics and GUI**: Java Swing or JavaFX for the graphical user interface
- **Audio**: Java Sound API or external libraries for playing audio
- **Version Control**: Git (optional)

## Features

1. **Snake Movement**: Players can control the snake's movement using arrow keys or other input methods.
2. **Apples**: Apples appear randomly on the game board, and when the snake eats an apple, it grows longer.
3. **Scoring**: Players earn points for each apple eaten, and the score is displayed on the screen.
4. **Pause and Start**: Players can pause and resume the game at any time.
5. **Moving Apples**: Apples move across the game board, increasing the challenge for players.
6. **Changing Backgrounds**: Players can switch between different backgrounds or themes to customize their gaming experience.
7. **Audio Effects**: Sound effects are played during various game events, such as eating an apple or colliding with a wall.

## Project Structure

The project structure typically includes the following components:

- **Main Class**: Contains the `main` method to start the game and initialize necessary components.
- **Snake Class**: Represents the snake object and includes methods for movement, growth, collision detection, etc.
- **Apple Class**: Represents the apple object and includes methods for spawning and moving apples.
- **Game Board Class**: Manages the game board, including rendering graphics, handling user input, and updating the game state.
- **Scoring Class**: Manages the player's score and updates it based on game events.
- **GUI Components**: Using Java Swing or JavaFX for creating the graphical user interface, including buttons, labels, etc.
- **Audio Manager Class**: Handles loading and playing audio files for sound effects.

## Implementation

The Snake Game is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, with each component responsible for specific functionalities. The game loop continuously updates the game state, rendering graphics, and handling user input. Audio effects are played using the Java Sound API or external libraries, and background images or themes are switched dynamically based on player preferences.

## Conclusion

The Snake Game provides a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages. By expanding the classic game with additional features such as scoring, pause and start functionality, moving apples, changing backgrounds, and audio effects, it offers a modern twist while preserving the nostalgic charm of the original game.
