# Memory Allocator Project

## Overview
The Memory Allocator project aims to implement a dynamic memory allocation library in C. This library provides functions for allocating, deallocating, and managing memory segments efficiently. It includes different allocation algorithms such as Best Fit, Worst Fit, First Fit, and Next Fit.

## Files
- `umem.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and structure definitions.
- `umem.c`: Implementation file containing the logic for memory allocation functions.
- `main.c`: Main program file used for testing the memory allocator library.

## Implementation Details
- **umem.h**: This header file contains function prototypes and structure definitions for the memory allocator library. It defines the `memseg_t` structure to represent memory segments and declares functions like `umeminit`, `umalloc`, `ufree`, and `umemdump`.

- **umem.c**: The implementation file contains the logic for memory allocation functions. It includes functions to initialize the memory allocator, allocate memory using different algorithms, free allocated memory, and coalesce free memory segments. The implementation supports Best Fit allocation, which finds the smallest chunk that fits the requested size. It also includes the implementation of other allocation algorithms like Worst Fit, First Fit, and Next Fit.

- **main.c**: This file contains the main program used for testing the memory allocator library. It initializes the memory allocator, allocates memory using different algorithms, frees allocated memory, and dumps the memory layout for debugging purposes.

## Testing
The project is tested extensively using various test cases to ensure the correctness and efficiency of the memory allocator library. Unit tests are conducted to verify the functionality of individual functions, while integration tests are performed to test the interaction between different components of the library.

## Future Improvements
- Optimization: Further optimization of memory allocation algorithms for better performance.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.
- Documentation: Enhance documentation to provide comprehensive information about the library's usage and internal workings.
